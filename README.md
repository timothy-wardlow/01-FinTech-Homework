# UofM FinTech Homework 01 - Tim Wardlow

## *== Overview and Origin ==*
#### **Name of company?**
* SoFi Technologies, Inc.
* Formerly Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V

#### **When was the company incorporated?**
* August 2011: Social Finance, Inc is founded by Stanford business school students—originally using an alumni-funded lending model to connect recent grads with alumni in their community. [1]

#### **Who are the founders of the company?**
* Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady meet at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. [2]

#### **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
* In 2011, the founders form SoFi in hopes they could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. [2]

#### **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
* SoFi started out utilizing an "alumni-funded" lending model that connected students and recent graduates with alumni and institutional investors via school specific student loan funds.[2] Investors received a financial return and borrowers received rates lower than what the federal government offered. The company sought to minimize defaults by focusing on low-risk students and graduates.[2]
* As SoFi's product offerings expanded to include mortgages, mortgage refinancing and personal loans, the company moved away from an alumni-funded model to a non-traditional underwriting approach focused on lending to financially responsible individuals. SoFi uses an underwriting model that examines free cash flow, professional history and education in addition to a history of responsible bill payment to evaluate its borrowers.[2]
* In 2021, SoFi announced they would be merging with a SPAC in order to go public at a $9 billion dollar valuation at the end of the first quarter of 2021. After going public, the overall valuation of SoFi increased by over 12%.[2]



## *== Business Activities ==*

#### **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
* SoFi aims to become a one-stop-shop for digital financial services. [5]
* "SoFi's mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions. And financial independence doesn't just mean being rich—it means getting to a point where your money works for the life you want to live. Everything we do is geared toward helping our members get their money right." [3]
* They are also venturing into the Payments/Billing and Crypto realms with the acquisition of Galileo and the addition of a feature in their app that allows members to purchase and exchange cryptocurrencies. So they could potentially be gearing up for the future of banking/finance in regards to blockchain.

#### **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
*  SoFi focuses on "financially responsible individuals"[2], younger generations who may be looking to refinance student loan debt (or take out new student loans) as well as home/auto loans and insurance. They offer a robust financial services platform that is "member-centric".
*  SoFi currently boasts "over 2.5 million members" on its official website. [1] 

#### **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
* Allow members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money with a robust financial services platform to offer products to members and meet their financial needs. [4]
* User-centric/friendly digital banking experience through mobile app.
* Free financial planning and career coaching for members along with access to exclusive events plus perks associated with SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.

#### **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**
* Its Technology Platform operates Technology Platform Services (Galileo) and Clearing Brokerage Services (Apex).[4]
* They also provide financial service solutions, including cash management and investment services across its SoFi Money, SoFi Invest, SoFi Credit Card and SoFi Relay products. [4]

## *== Landscape ==*

#### **What domain(s) of the financial industry is the company in?**
* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking
* Lending
* Investment Management/Wealth Management
* Insurance
* Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (sales/exchange) 
* Payments/Billing (Purchased Galileo in 2020)

#### **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
* Big data and advanced analytics
* Process Automation (AI, Machine Learning)
* Cloud Computing — Drives costs down as banks do not need to make significant investments in software and hardware infrastructure. Makes developing/launching new products easier, and helps banks respond to client demand faster. Allows banks to store big data, while using powerful data analytics and machine learning to gain valuable insights into customer behavior.
* APIs — Enables banks to collect and combine customer data in order to gain insights into consumer behavior and target the right market with the right financial services/products. Banks can monetize access to raw data and banking services to create alternative sources of revenue. Speeds up the development time and delivery of new products and services. 

#### **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
* LendingClub
* Ally
* Upstart
* Chime

## *== Results ==*

#### **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
* SoFi has been viewed as somewhat of a disrupter up to this point. Starting out primarily in the student loan business, SoFi is following a flywheel approach of stacking features/products/services into its core experience in order to drive growth and usuage. It seems to be very effective amongst its core demographic, students and young adults. 

#### **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
* Total Gross Revenue - "Revenues also grew triple-digits at 101% year over year (YoY) to $231.3 million, while adjusted net revenue for the quarter climbed 74% YoY and came in well above guidance of between 58 to 61% YoY growth;" [5]
* EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) — "... the company generated $61 million of positive EBITDA over the past 12 months, a significant improvement from the $149 million of losses experienced for the full year of 2019." [5]
* Acquisition/Usuage Metrics — "Growth in members and products accelerated as well, all growing by triple-digit percentages, and marking the 8th consecutive quarter of accelerating YoY growth in total members for SoFi." [5]



#### **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
* SoFi appears to be ahead of its competitors in terms of KPIs as well as public perception. One could point to their member-centric approach, user-friendly financial products/services and the company's marketing efforts. A major effort was the purchase of the naming rights to SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, CA, USA.

## *== Recommendations ==*

#### **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
* I would advise that they invest further in blockchain technology (although they appear to be gearing up to venture further into this domain with the acquisitions of Galileo and Apex) in order to beat their competitors to the future of the finance industry. One particular facet of blockchain that I would be interested to see SoFi tackle would be the improvement in efficiency of the life cycle of a syndicated loan. 

#### **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
* I believe that if SoFi were to improve the efficiency of the life cycle of a syndicated loan, it would even further set them apart from their competitors. Businesses(or individuals) would be attracted to a fast, efficient syndicated loan process oppossed to the inefficient methods in place now. In turn, this would potentially expedite business launches, product releases, project timelines and much more. 

#### **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
* Blockchain - Utilizing blockchain as a ledger that can be referenced back to by all lenders.
* APIs - Utilizing APIs to connect lendees to lenders.

#### **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?** 
* These technologies would be neccessary in order to re-invent the life cycle of a syndicated loan. Without Blockchain, there would be no universal, decentralized ledger for all involved lenders to reference back to when working through the loan process. 
* APIs are neccessary in order to connect lendees to lenders digitally.
